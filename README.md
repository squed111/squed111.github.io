Coding Portfolio<br><br>
Project Description:<br>
This is my coding portfolio.  I have included a couple of pages to showcase some design ideas and skills.  On the landing page, I used a photo of the MIT Chapel, as I hold not only an interest in architecture, but I am also a man of faith.  This photo symbolized my faith, my fondness of not only architecture but also photography, graphic design, and creativity in general.  It also symbolizes the school of MIT, which is the school who sponsors the program I am currently enrolled in.  On the About Me page, I used a black background, with white and gold text.  I did this programmaticaly, and not in a pre-set dark mode.  I utilized Bootstrap's grid to wrap the text and video next to the photo.  The photo was edited to be Black and White and had the background of the photo removed.  For the Project Overview page, I went with the classic white with black color scheme, but styled the text with a Garamond Serif font.  I used Bootstrap cards to showcase the projects, and used actual screenshots of the projects to give an example of the project in action.  I also linked those cards to the project repositories and pages that run them live.  I did not link the bus tracking project because I was having an issue of not displaying my personal APIs in the repository for this page.

How To Run:<br>
As this is my Github Page, simply go to <a href="https://squed111.github.io"> squed111.github.io </a> to see it in action.

Future Improvements:<br>
I would like to add more projects, but that goes without saying.  I would also like to add a section that showcases the Certificates of Completion that I am starting to acquire.  As for the changing the pages I have so far, I would like to see if I can get the bus tracker to work without giving away API keys; along with the improvements that I have mentioned for each project in their own repositories.
